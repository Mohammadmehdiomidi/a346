This page shows an example of a multinomial logistic regression analysis with footnotes explaining the output. The data were collected on 200 high school students and are scores on various tests, including a video game and a puzzle. The outcome measure in this analysis is the student’s favorite flavor of ice cream – vanilla, chocolate or strawberry- from which we are going to see what relationships exists with video game scores (video), puzzle scores (puzzle) and gender (female). 
Variable name	Variable 	Data type
Id	Identity of the student	Nominal
female	Gender (0: Male, 1:Female)	Binary
ice_cream	Favorite Flavor (1: Vanilla, 2: Chocolate, 3: Strawberry)	Nominal
video	Score on the video game	Scale/Continuous
puzzle	Score on the puzzle	Scale/Continuous

ice_cream is the dependent variable (the predicted variable).
female, video and puzzle are the independent variables (the predictors).
